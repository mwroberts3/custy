## Usage & Features

_Custy_ is a simple browser based customer service tracker built with React.

This app stores and retrieves data using local storage, so it's well suited for a dedicated work computer.

Added todos can be marked as "urgent" or "waiting for response".

## Future Features

- reminder feature
- undo delete
- some kind of web-socket use so changes are reflected in all browser instances
- dark mode

## Version Changes

1.0.1 - 3/29/21

- fixed bug that displayed add and edit todo forms simultaneously
- added 10px margin to top of the add and edit forms, so there's some separation with the button
