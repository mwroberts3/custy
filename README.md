## Usage & Features

_Custy_ is a simple browser based customer service tracker built with React.

This app stores and retrieves data using local storage, so it's well suited for a dedicated work computer.

Added todos can be marked as "urgent" or "waiting for response".

## Future Features

- reminder feature
- undo delete
- some kind of web-socket use so changes are reflected in all browser instances
- dark mode
